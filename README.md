Ships 6 is a brand new version of Ships. Ships 6 allows developers to hook into more Ships API then ever before, allows Server Admins to control the Ships plugin to a finer detail and allows the server users features that has never been seen before.

Ships 6 has been reprogrammed from the ground up like Ships 5 was, however this time Ships 6 completely reprograms Ships, this means the old block detection system (prototype 3) is not in use by default. This means the server is less likely to crash due to someone attempting to move a ship. The movement system has also been improved making the server playable even if someone is moving a large ship. 

There are many new features in Ships 6, you must experience it
